# Personal Website

Source code for my personal site [aaronmanning.net](https://www.aaronmanning.net).

Source code for site generation program is in [site-generation](site-generation).

Running the sole target in the makefile will generate the single `index.html` page in `website`, where this site deploys from.

Site screenshot thumbnails are created using [site-shot](https://www.site-shot.com/).
